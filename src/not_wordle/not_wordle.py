	Welcome to Definitely Not Wordle! The rules are similar to Wordle but it's not Wordle.
	Rules:
	- The program will randomly generate a 5-letter word
	- You have 6 chances to guess the word
	- After each guess, there'll be '+', '?', '-' printed out
		- '+' means the letter you guessed is at the right place (there could be repeating letters per word!)
		- '?' means the letter you guessed is in the word but it's not at the right place
		- '-' means the letter you guessed isn't in the word
	- After finishing the round, the program (should) copy the results to your clipboard so 
		you can just paste them into the slack channel if you'd like :)
		- If it isn't copied to your clipboard you can still copy the results manually to share

	You can now press 'Enter' to continue
